    - Development Environment: Eclipse IDE (Java SE 16)

- Under **class Main**, there are **6 methods** created for the 4 tasks.
    
        - problem1()
        - calculateVolume(double radius)
  
        - problem2()
        - primeCheck(int n, int m)
  
        - problem3()
        - problem4()

- **1st task**
**the formula below** is used to calculate volumes.

        4/3*Math.PI*Math.pow(radius, 3)

- **2nd task**
a **recursive helper method** created to check if the number is prime

- **3rd task**
all characters in the text converted to **char** variable to check if they are letters, vowels or spaces

- **4th task**
all words in the text are compared with each other with the method below

        "first_text".compareTo("second_text")
